                        Heritage Site, stands out for its extraordinary surroundings and architectural beauty. It
                        encompasses a Catholic Shrine featuring a church, a monumental stairway symbolizing the Way of
                        the Cross, and a surrounding forest. Notable features include the Basilica, shaped like a Latin
                        cross and one of Portugal's earliest neoclassical buildings, and the impressive stairway divided
                        into three sections: the portico stairway, the stairway of the five senses, and the stairway of
                        the three virtues of faith, hope, and charity. The Santo Ildefonso Church in Porto, rebuilt in
                        the 18th century, showcases exquisite artistry, with its façade adorned with two bell-towers and
                        painted tiles illustrating scenes from the life of Saint Ildefonsus. The Jerónimos Monastery in
                        Lisbon, a pinnacle of Manueline architecture, is a UNESCO World Heritage site and one of
                        Portugal's seven wonders. Noteworthy features include its intricate entrances sculpted in honor
                        of King Manuel I. The Batalha Monastery, also known as the Santa Maria da Vitória Monastery, is
                        a Gothic masterpiece built to commemorate a victory over the Castilians. Classified as a UNESCO
                        World Heritage site, it represents an outstanding example of Portuguese Gothic architecture.  <a href="churches.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="button">Learn More</a>

                        The National Palace of Pena, perched atop Sintra's highest hill, is renowned for its vibrant
                        facade and strategic location, blending Manueline and Moorish architectural styles. A UNESCO
                        World Heritage site, it evolved from a Middle Ages chapel to a monastery, and finally into a
                        castle. The 16th-century Belém Tower in Lisbon, adorned with symbols of King Manuel I, served as
                        a prison during the Spanish invasion and a defense against pirate attacks, symbolizing
                        Portugal's naval power. The Castle of the Moors, an 8th and 9th-century Moorish fort, offers
                        stunning views from its steep hilltop location but was abandoned in the 15th century. Guimarães
                        Castle, a 10th-century fortress, played a crucial role in Portugal's independence, withstanding
                        the Battle of São Mamede in 1128, earning the title "birthplace of the Portuguese nation."
                        Almourol Castle, situated on a rocky island in the Tagus River, dates back to the 12th century
                        and remains remarkably well-preserved, controlling a strategic waterway and deriving its name
                        from the Arabic word for "high rock." <a href="castles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="button">Learn More</a>
